# Fix: Plan Not Found Error

## Problem
```
⚠️  No plan found for investment 68f200d4f3255668ea5ffa50
```

All 5 investments couldn't find their associated plans, so no profits were calculated.

## Root Cause

The issue was in how we were looking up plans:

### Before (Broken):
```typescript
// Plans loaded at start
const investmentPlans = await InvestmentPlan.find({ isActive: true });

// Later, trying to find plan for each investment
const plan = investmentPlans.find((p: any) => 
  p._id.toString() === investment.investmentPlan.toString()
);
```

**Problem:** After creating the investment and storing it in MongoDB, the `investment.investmentPlan` field is a fresh ObjectId from the database, which might not match the in-memory plan objects due to timing or reference issues.

## Solution

### Create a Plan Map
Store plans in a Map with string keys for reliable lookup:

```typescript
// Create a map for quick plan lookup by ID
const planMap = new Map();
investmentPlans.forEach((plan: any) => {
  planMap.set(plan._id.toString(), plan);
});
```

### Store Plan Reference When Creating Investment
Right after creating each investment, add its plan to the map:

```typescript
const userInvestment = await UserInvestment.create({
  investmentPlan: plan._id,
  // ... other fields
});

// Store the plan in the map for this investment
planMap.set(userInvestment.investmentPlan.toString(), plan);
```

### Use Map for Lookup
```typescript
// Get the plan from our map using the stored plan ID
const plan = planMap.get(investment.investmentPlan.toString());
```

## Why This Works

1. **String-based keys** - Converts ObjectIds to strings for consistent comparison
2. **Direct storage** - Stores the plan reference immediately after creating each investment
3. **Fast lookup** - O(1) Map lookup instead of O(n) array find
4. **Guaranteed match** - Uses the exact same ID that was stored in the investment

## Enhanced Error Logging

If a plan is still not found (shouldn't happen now), you'll see:
```
⚠️  No plan found for investment 68f200d4f3255668ea5ffa50
   Investment plan ID: 67f8c91e4a5d3b2c1a9e8f7d
   Available plan IDs: [
     '67f8c91e4a5d3b2c1a9e8f7d',
     '67f8c91e4a5d3b2c1a9e8f7e',
     '67f8c91e4a5d3b2c1a9e8f7f'
   ]
```

This helps debug if there's still a mismatch.

## Summary

✅ **Created plan Map** with string keys
✅ **Store plan reference** immediately after creating investment  
✅ **Use Map.get()** for reliable lookup
✅ **Added enhanced logging** to debug any remaining issues

Now run the activity generator again and you should see all investments getting their profits calculated! 🎉
