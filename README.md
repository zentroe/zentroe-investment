## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### **Potential Blockers**
1. **Stripe Integration Complexity** - Allocate extra time for payment testing
2. **Backend Integration Issues** - Have fallback mock data ready
3. **Time Constraints** - Focus on MVP features first

### **Contingency Plans**
- ✅ Prioritize payment flow over admin features if time is short
- ✅ Use mock data if backend integration is delayed
- ✅ Deploy with basic features and iterate post-weekend

## 💡 **FUTURE BACKEND PRIORITIES**

### **1. Transaction History & Detailed Investment Analytics:**
- Create additional endpoints that aggregate a user's transaction history
- Calculate total investment, returns earned, etc.

### **2. Monthly Returns Distribution:**
- Implement a scheduled task (using cron or a job queue like Bull) to simulate or distribute monthly returns
- Create endpoints to view updated portfolio performance over time

### **3. Payment Gateway Integration:**
- Integrate with a payment processor (e.g., Stripe, Paystack, or Flutterwave) to handle real money investments
- Create secure endpoints for depositing/withdrawing funds

### **4. Enhanced Security & Data Validation:**
- Use libraries like express-validator to validate incoming request bodies
- Add further security measures (rate limiting, input sanitization, etc.)
 *
 * 5. Comprehensive Admin Dashboard Endpoints:
 *    - Create endpoints for admins to view overall platform analytics,
 *      including investment statistics, user demographics, and transaction summaries.
 *
 * 6. API Documentation:
 *    - Develop API documentation using Swagger or similar tools for easier frontend integration.
